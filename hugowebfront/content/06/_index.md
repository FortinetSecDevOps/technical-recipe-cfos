{{< notice info >}}
* Cluster POD to POD Traffic: eth0 (Application Pod) <--> eth0 (cFOS Pod).
* Internet Traffic: Application Pod ---> net1 (cFOS Pod) ---> eth0 (sNAT enabled) ---> Internet.
* The eth0 interfaces are managed by Multus with delegation to `AWS VPC CNI`, and the net1 interfaces are managed by Multus with delegation to `macvlan CNI`.
{{< /notice >}}

Amazon EKS supports Multus, a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that enables you to attach multiple network interfaces to your Kubernetes pods. This can be useful for workloads requiring additional network isolation or advanced networking features. In this demo, application pod will use additional network to communicate with cFOS. so we will need install multus with additional CNI. 

> **_NOTE:_** To use Multus on Amazon EKS, you'll need to install and configure it manually. 

the idea is use gatekeeper with opa policy to review the networkpolicy , if the networkpolicy meet the constraintTemplate. the contraintTemplate will use cFOS restful API to create a firewall policy on cFOS.
