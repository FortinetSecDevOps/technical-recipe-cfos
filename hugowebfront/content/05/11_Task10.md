### Task 10 - Scale the app Deployment

Let's scale replicas from 2 to 4 for ***testtest-deployment*** which has pod label ***app=newtest***.

* The firewall addrgroup name is created by ***clientpod*** by combine the namespace and label which is ***defaultappnewtest***. 

```
kubectl scale deployment testtest-deployment --replicas=4 &&
kubectl get pod -l app=newtest
```

> output will be similar as below

```
deployment.apps/testtest-deployment scaled
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

> you can use below cli command to check the ip address for each pod on net1 interface 

```
kubectl get pod | grep testtest | awk '{print $1}'  | while read line; do kubectl  exec po/$line -- ip -4 --br a show dev net1; done
```

> output will be similar as below

```
