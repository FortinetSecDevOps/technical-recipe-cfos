### Task 10 - scale the app deployment 

let's scale replicas from 2 to 4 for testtest-deployment which has pod label app=newtest, the firewall addrgroup name is created by clientpod 
by combine the namespace and label which is defaultappnewtest. 

```
kubectl scale deployment testtest-deployment --replicas=4 &&
kubectl get pod -l app=newtest
```
you shall see output 

```
deployment.apps/testtest-deployment scaled
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
testtest-deployment-5768f678d7-4b4wf   1/1     Running   0          110s
testtest-deployment-5768f678d7-8m52w   1/1     Running   0          12m
testtest-deployment-5768f678d7-nxlvq   1/1     Running   0          110s
testtest-deployment-5768f678d7-vdmv5   1/1     Running   0          12m
```
you can use below cli command to check the ip address for each pod on net1 interface 

```
kubectl get pod | grep testtest | awk '{print $1}'  | while read line; do kubectl  exec po/$line -- ip -4 --br a show dev net1; done
```
the output will be 

```
net1@if2         UP             10.1.200.25/24
net1@if2         UP             10.1.200.24/24
net1@if2         UP             10.1.200.23/24
net1@if2         UP             10.1.200.26/24
```
